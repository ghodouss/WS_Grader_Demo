# Worksheet Reader Demo

Early childhood education is a field which I am extremely interested in. Over high school, I volunteering for and ran various tutoring programs as well as a summer school. As a result, as soon as I developed an affinity for ML, I have been looking to build tools for the education system, which I believe could benefit greatly from a smart, frugal integration of technology within its system. Which brings me to this current module.

I have completed the bare bones of a worksheet grading machine learning model. This model is part of a much larger Edtech platform that I am currently working on. As a result, I am not going to be able to show the code for the module, but I am going to give a demo of its current functionality
